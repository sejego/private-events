# Private Events

## Description

This is a simple Events Listing website created with Ruby on Rails for The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/private-events). Main aim of this project was to learn to use ActiveRecord associations, as they make it possible to associate events with their creators and attendees. The site allows checking out all the events present on the website, but in order to check the details or attend one - the user must register/log in. Front-end is realized in plain CSS. The app is deployed on Heroku.
